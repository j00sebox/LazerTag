# LazerTag

A multiplayer FPS made with Unreal Engine 4.

## Gameplay

Once the game starts the players will have to gain points by shooting each other with their laser guns. If the score limit is reached or time runs out the match is over.
In order to manuever the player has mobility options such as running, crouching, sliding and wall running. Use this mobility to avoid getting hit. The player also has access to shields that randomly spawn within the map. Each player can hold two shield charges. Getting hit while having a shield will remove a charge but will not award points to the other player.
